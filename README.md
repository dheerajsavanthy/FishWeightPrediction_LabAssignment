# FishWeightPrediction_LabAssignment

The project has been created as part of a Lab Assignment at Durham College.

#### Introduction
The aim of the project is to develop a fully functional web application that is supported by a machine learning model. The web application is programmed in python supported by Flask framework and is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform. The application uses the user input data intended from a fish market vendor about the dimensions of the fish to determine the weight of the fish for purchase.

The model used for prediction is a simple Linear Regression and the data has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The name of the dataset is [Fish Market](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market)
