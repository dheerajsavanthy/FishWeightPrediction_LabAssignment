# FishWeightPrediction_LabAssignment

The project has been created as part of a Lab Assignment at Durham College.

### Introduction
The aim of the project is to develop a fully functional web application that is supported by a machine learning model. The web application is programmed in python supported by Flask framework and is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform. The application uses the user input data intended from a fish market vendor about the dimensions of the fish to determine the weight of the fish for purchase.

The model used for prediction is a simple Linear Regression and the data has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The name of the dataset used to train our model is [Fish Market](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market). The user-interface and API for the application has been designed using HTML and styled with CSS in such a way that user gives input numeric values of the dimensions of the fish and clicks on the 'Predict' button wherein the pre-trained model receives the input to predict the weight and gives the output back which is then displayed on screen.

### Technology & Prerequisites

*Flask* is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

*Python* is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Install a stable version onto your computer before starting this project. Then install all the packages mentioned in the requirements.txt file

An IDE to program - Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio

To manage the project or attain access, get *Git Bash*

*Heroku* is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007 which now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. An account on the platform is required in order to deploy the application.

### Project Installation

To install the project, please download or clone properly using repository url. All necessary tools and libraries are already provided within installation. To clone the repository using Git Bash follow below steps:

1) Open GitHub and go to the GitHub repository that you want to clone.
2) Click “Code” and copy the given URL.
3) Open Git Bash and change to the location where you want the cloned directory.
4) Type 'git clone' in the terminal and paste the URL you copied, press “Enter” to create your local clone.

### Cloud Deployment

For deployment of the application, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) Cloud Platform has been chosen. Once the project has been saved onto a GitHub repository, it can be directly deployed from the repository onto the Heroku Cloud by linking the GitHub account to your Heroku Account.
